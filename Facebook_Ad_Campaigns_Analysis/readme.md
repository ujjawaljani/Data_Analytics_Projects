<li>Impressions: the number of times the ad was shown.</li>
<li>Clicks: number of clicks on for that ad.</li>

## Insights
<ul>
<li>"Impressions", "Clicks" and "Spent" are positively correlated with each other.</li>
<li>Campaign1 has the greatest number of ads.</li>
<li>Thus, Campaign1 has better Approved_conversion count, i.e. most people bought products in campaign1.</li>
<li>The age group of 30-34 shows more interest in buying products through ads.</li>
<li>Both the genders shows similar interests in all three campaigns.</li>
<li>Although the count of interest after 100 is less,there is a rise of users after 100 who actually bought the product. Rest of the distribution is according to what was expected.</li>
<li>As the amount of money spent increases, number of product bought increases.</li>
<li>It seems men tend to click more than women but women buy more products than men after clicking the add.</li>
</ul>
