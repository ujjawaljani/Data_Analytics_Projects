<h2>Importance of Sales Analysis</h2>
<h3><b>1) Missed opportunities :</b></h3>
Analyzing the available data can show the company where it has missed the opportunity and if or not that can be claimed. Market research will play an important role in this presenting data to compare while the field force will prove of valuable assistance in informing the practicalities of the situation.

<h3><b>2) Future decisions :</b></h3>
Sales data will help a company to take a future decision in terms of inventory management, marketing activities, schemes or offers to be rolled and changes in manufacturing processes if applicable. Based on Sales data, major decisions like continuing or discontinuing a product is taken. Those future decisions will help the external stakeholders of the company to decide whether or not to invest in the company.

<h3><b>3) Market Trends :</b></h3>
Sales analysis will also show the current market trends to the company. While the company may be preparing to launch a new product, Sales Analysis would show a drastic increase in Sales of the earlier product after an activity, showing that it was the lack of awareness which was a hindrance in realizing Sales and not the product. Also, Sales of a certain product may skyrocket during a festival or decrease seasonally.

<h3><b>4) Customer analysis :</b></h3>
Effectively, Sales Analysis is nothing but Customer Analysis. Answering why did a particular customer buy the product in a particular month may give crucial customer insights which will help with the planning of the company.
